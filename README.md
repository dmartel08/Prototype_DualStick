# Project_END

---Notes---
To fix git/unity's ignore bullshit do this:
- set the ignore before the file is committed. If a file is committed, then it won't ignore.
- If you're an unfortunate fool like me, commit, then remove the files/folders from the project entirely (move to desktop or something). 
-Commit the project again with the .gitignore set up correctly. 
- Add those files/folders back in.
- BAM they'll be ignored.
